#Hamiltonian cycles are a graph theoretic concept. A HC touches every vertex at exactly once,
    and ends at the vertex where it began. The traveling salesman problem is an attempt to find
    the shortest HC. The traveling salesman problem is an NP-Hard problem.

-must find the most efficient way to store a graph. array, dictionary?
-utilize pre-existing algorithms?

consideration:
    -begin at lowest-weighted edge. 
    -choose the next smallest weighted edge among its connections.
        how to avoid halting problem if two edges are of the same weight
    -has every vertex been used/touched, and does the cycle end at the vertex
    where it began?

    if yes, print cycle
    if no, return to line 10

what if no cycle exists? return "no HC exists"

-graph storage must accept considerations such as hypergraphs and vertices with multiple connections.

take edges as inputs, or vertices? which is simpler, if at all, and/or more computationally advantageous?

?????    - - begin with any vertex. 
        vertex_a = str(input("type a vertex: ")(
        vertex_a = user given name of aforementioned vertex
        
   - -  take its connections and their weights as inputted tuples
        vertex_a_connections = input("what are a's connections and their weights
